## Design

<strong>Look and feel</strong>

For the design of this website, I wanted to create a feeling of calm and relaxation for users when viewing my site. To do this I utilised a range of orange shades to create a cohesive visual palette. These colours vary from soft and warm tones to bolder tones, adding depth and contrast to the design.

<strong>Font</strong>

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for my font selection.

Ysabeau Infant was used as the font for this website. This font was choosen because I felt like it added to the calm and relaxing feel of the site. Fall back font is Sans-serif.

## Wireframes

Before starting the project, I created wireframes to map out the initial design and functionality. These wireframes served as a blueprint to guide the development process. However, as the project progressed, I deviated from the original plan in several areas.

This evolution was driven by practical considerations, feedback during development, and a focus on improving usability. I revisited the initial design choices and implemented adjustments that enhanced the overall user experience. The final design reflects these improvements, resulting in a more intuitive and user-friendly interface than originally envisioned.

By allowing flexibility in the design process, I was able to refine and elevate the project's quality beyond the initial concept.

<strong>About Us & Contact Pages</strong>

This pages were not used in the final project, instead the About Us including how to contact the spa were incorporated into a seperate Book Appointment page.

## Agile Development

Link to my [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/catgriffin85/projects/4)

This was my first experience with Agile Development, and I chose to use the Kanban framework alongside the MoSCoW prioritization method. To manage the workflow, I utilized GitHub Projects to create a Kanban board.

As a solo developer working under strict timelines, I found creating all the Epics and User Stories to be somewhat time-consuming. However, I can see the significant advantages of this approach, particularly in a team setting, where it promotes organization and collaboration.

Moving forward, I plan to continue using Agile methodologies in my future projects to further develop my skills.

I created 4 columns - Open, In progress, Done and No Longer Required. 

For the MoSCoW priorisation I used - Must Have (MVP), Should Have and Nice to Have.

## Tools and technologies used

<strong>Languages and Frameworks</strong>

This project was created using the following languages and frameworks:

* Django as the Python web framework.
    * Python as the backend programming language.
* HTML as the markup language and templating language.
* CSS as the style sheet language.
* Bootstrap 5 as the CSS framework.

<strong>Django Packages</strong>

Django installs some packages by default and some packages I installed. Below are a list of the main packages I used and a description. Description taken from the web.

Django Python - pip3 install Django~=4.2.1

<u>Gunicorn</u>

gunicorn is a production equivalent of the manage.py runserver used in development but with speed and security optimisation.

<u>Whitenoise</u>

WhiteNoise works with any WSGI-compatible app but has some special auto-configuration features for Django. WhiteNoise takes care of best-practices.

<u>Psycopg2</u>

psycopg2 is a driver for interacting with PostgreSQL databases using Python. The dj-database-url Python package is a utility to connect Django to a database using a URL.

<u>Allauth</u>

Django-allauth is a Django package that provides a set of views, templates, and helper functions to handle user authentication, registration, and account management.

<u>Django summernote</u>

Django summernote transforms the admin page, allowing rich text, that is, text with various formats like headings and paragraphs, unlike the plain text that Django's default textarea supports. It embeds a 'what you see is what you get' (WYSIWYG) editor, offering a live preview of the content and making editing intuitive.

<u>Django-crispy-forms</u>

Django-crispy-forms provides you with a |crispy filter and {% crispy %} tag that will let you control the rendering behavior of your Django forms in a very elegant and DRY way. Have full control without writing custom form templates.

<u>Django-flatpickr</u>

This django widget contains Date-Picker, Time-Picker, DateTime-Picker input widgets with date-range-picker functionality for django version >= 2.0. The widget implements flatpickr to display date-pickers in django model forms and custom forms which can be configured easily for date-range selection.

<strong>Other tools used</strong>

* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) was used for all icons.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the wireframes.
* [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) was used to create the favicon.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) for hosting repositories.
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) where the website is deployed.


## Features




## Testing

Thorough testing was a crucial part of this project to ensure functionality, usability, and reliability. I implemented a range of testing methods to identify and resolve issues at different stages of development. These included manual testing for user experience, functional testing to confirm that features behaved as intended, and debugging to address any errors or inconsistencies.

This section outlines the tests conducted during the project, the issues identified, and the steps taken to resolve them. Additionally, I highlight any limitations discovered during testing and suggest potential areas for future improvement.

## Bugs

<strong>Fixed Bugs</strong>

After creating my first database, I change the name of the model but it didnâ€™t change the name of the database. I deleted the migration and migrated again but that didnâ€™t fix it. I had to add code to the meta class to change the name of the database which then worked.


<strong>Unfixed Bugs</strong>

When users open the date picker to select an appointment I wanted to disable the list of blocked dates on the calendar. After many tries, googling, talking to my mentor I could not get it to work the way I wanted it to work. I did manage to block out Sundays but any time I disabled the blocked dates it changed the format of my date picker which I didn't want. Ultimately I decided to proceed without the dates being blocked on the date picker but users will get an error message if they try to select one of the blocked dates.
